# Anti-Lag-Mod
An anti lag mod for Beatsaber. Pauses your game after a desired threshold of frames are dropped or certain tracking issues are detected.
**NOTE THAT THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE AND MAY HAVE BUGS**

If the mod isnt working properly, It will tell you in the settings that it has shut itself off to prevent further problems. You can fix this by restarting your game. If you find bugs, report them here, game logs are appreciated! You can find the log in `\Beat Saber\Logs\_latest.txt`

# Installation:

# Advanced Settings:
This isnt that very important but if you feel the need to change the Y offset of the Bounding Box you can do so under `playerHeight` in `BeatSaber\UserData\AntiLagMod.json`
